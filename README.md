This is a bike fit calculator that takes a users input for an ideal handlebar position, and a chosen frame geometry + theoretical headset configuration
it will return a short summary of how close that particular configuration is from their ideal fit 
Clear inputs will clear the input space and current returned paragraph 
save inputs will save the current entry into a list below which can be copy and pasted to the client 
clear all clears everything
